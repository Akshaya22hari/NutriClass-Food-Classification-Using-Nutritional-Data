# NutriClass-Food-Classification-Using-Nutritional-Data
This project involves developing a machine learning model that classifies food into multiple categories using tabular data. By the end of this project,  we will be able to create a robust classification system that can accurately label food types and gain insights into what makes each food category distinct management systems
## 📘 Overview

NutriClass is a machine learning project designed to classify food items based on their nutritional content. Using features like calories, proteins, carbohydrates, fats, and sugars, it trains multiple classification models to categorize food into distinct groups. This helps build intelligent systems for diet planning, food logging, and personalized nutrition.

## 🔍 Project Approach

### 1. Data Understanding & Exploration
- Load and inspect the dataset
- Analyze class distribution and sample variation
- Check for imbalance and noise

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and duplicates
- Detect/remove outliers
- Normalize or standardize features

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)
- Encode categorical values

### 4. Model Selection
Train and evaluate:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost
- Gradient Boosting Classifier
